# CycleRental_Project
The purpose of the proposed system is to automate the entire cycle providing service. It includes a web application into which registered users can log into and look for the availability of the public sharing cycles in the cycle stations. The user can book the cycle slots as well as cancel them. The proposed system has an automatic lock and unlock system. The user can take the cycle from any cycle station and drop it at any other. The user needs to pay a small amount as per usage which is automatically deducted from the userâ€™s smart card.
Involves hardware prototyping with Node microcontroller, servo motors, RFID identification with RFID reader.
